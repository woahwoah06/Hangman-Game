# --Hangman Game--

Greetings! This game is my third mini-project in Python and also my second upload on GitHub.  
This game is about trying to guess a randomly selected word by entering random letters.

# --Getting Started--

**Step 1** - Download Python
**Step 2** - Run the game

# --Rules/Mechanics--

This is pretty much your average hangman game; a random word is chosen, you gotta guess it,  
choosing letters fills in the blank... the usual stuff, if you don't know how to play hangman,  
just look it up.
